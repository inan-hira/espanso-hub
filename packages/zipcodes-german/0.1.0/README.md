# German Zip Codes

The Information for this package was pulled on 01.04.2025 from https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/georef-germany-postleitzahl/table/

Please Please be aware, that I will not update this Package whenever there is a change in the Zip Codes. However, maybe there is a way to use the API of Opendatasoft to check for that Information automaticaly.

The search works both ways. You use a ! followed by the town name or the zip code. If there are multiple matches for the town you will get a menu to choose the right from. The output will be like 'ZIP-Code Town-Name'.
